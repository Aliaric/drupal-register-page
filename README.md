# drupal-register-page

A Toptal Drupal task.

Create a module and use it to register a page (path). This page should be accessible only to registered users and should use a template file for formatting the content output. Requirements: 

- The page title should be "Toptal page title."
- The page should be available at path: /toptal-page.
- The template file should render the page subtitle (formatted as <h2 class="page-subtitle">) and page content (formatted as <div class="page-content">).
- If the page subtitle and page content are not provided by a theme call, theme should use default options, such as "Toptal default subtitle" and "Toptal default content."
